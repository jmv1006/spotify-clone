# Spotify-Clone

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## General Information
This is a small-scale replica of the Spotify desktop website. It was built using React, React Router, Firestore and Firebase Hosting. 

## Features
- A sleek home page showcasing different categories with corresponding playlists.
- Each displayed playlist has its own individual page displaying the tracks within it, as well as artist and album names.
- Feel free to add your own categories and playlist with the use of the Spotify Web API! 

## Adding A New Category
In order to add a new category, you must:
- Create and intialize a Firebase project using Firestore.
- Retrieve your own Token from the [Spotify For Developers Website](https://developer.spotify.com).
- Access the `spotifyAPI.js` JavaScript file and insert your token in the `spotifyApi.setAccessToken` function.
- Create an array containing the ids of the playlists you would like in your category. (Each Spotify playlist has an individual id that lives in the page's url after /playlist/).
- Uncomment and call the `sendPlaylistsToFirebase` function with the array of playlists as the first parameter and a name for the category as the second parameter.
- Ensure to make the line containing the `sendPlaylistsToFirebase` a comment again so that it is not called when not needed.
- Done!


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
